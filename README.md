# Flappy-Bird-Pygame-README

This is a fun flappy bird game I made in my communications technology class at WCI, just thought I would upload it to GitHub if anyone would like to check it out!

Note, if you are trying to download and run the game, you're going to need to install Python and Pygame then you're going to have to run "main.py"
